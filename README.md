<br>A super-simple terminal based dictionary built with python and bash.

You will need to make the bash file globally accessible to run it from the terminal.

To make a bash file globally accessible, it is required to, <br>
Add the directory you wish for Linux to search, which is also where your script is located.<br>
Add the directory in the file .bashrc (which is located in the home folder and hidden; press Ctrl+H to see hidden files).<br>For example, I had to add the directory /home/vishaag/hacks/bash_scripts at the top of the .bashrc file (using a text editor like gedit/kate etc. ).<br>
After this, linux can access your bash script from this folder.

For a more details on the working of the script, please check out <a href="https://techmusinghacks.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/terminal-based-online-dictionary-built-with-pythonbash3/">this</a> post on my blog</a>.
